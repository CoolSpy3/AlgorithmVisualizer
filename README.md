# AlgorithmVisualizer
Work in progress. Using pygame to do all the work (although I'm still pretty unfamiliar with python in general)<br>
Hopefully when its done it will have the following features:<br>
-Visualize sorting algorithms and make it make cool sounds<br>
&emsp;-Few O(n^2) algorithms - FINISHED<br> 
&emsp;-Mergesort and Quicksort - FINISHED<br> 
&emsp;-Heapsort - FINISHED<br> 
&emsp;-Finish UI (scrolling through sorts, adding file input for custom arrays, advanced options like time delay)<br>
&emsp;-Counting Sort and other noncomparison O(n) sorts with auxillary array - FINISHED<br>
-Visualize graph algorithms on a grid or a graph with nodes<br>
&emsp;-DFS and BFS<br>
&emsp;-Shortest paths/Minimum spanning Tree (Djistra's, Prim's, Kruskal's)<br>
&emsp;-Topological Sort<br>
-Custom graph creator<br>
&emsp;-Can drag nodes and edges<br>
&emsp;-Can make nodes/edges have special properties (Ex: Bipartite)<br>
-Visualization of Data Structures<br>
&emsp;-Trees<br>
&emsp;-Heaps<br>
&emsp;-DSU<br>
&emsp;-Stack/Queues/Priority Queues<br>
-Others<br>
&emsp;-KMP String Matching<br>
